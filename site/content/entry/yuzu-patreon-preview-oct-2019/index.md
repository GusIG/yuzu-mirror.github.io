## Changelog

Since the last Patreon release, we've made great progress in the OS emulation and GPU emulation areas.
While some of the changes listed below are already in master or tagged for Canary, some are being released as early access to the patrons, with this build.

### OS Emulation (OS HLE)

`Public Changes`

- [#2877](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2877) - Implemented `REV5 Audio`'s frame count.
- [#2873](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2873) - Implemented `ioctl2` & `ioctl3` interfaces in `NVDRV` (Nvidia Services).
- [#2912](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2912) - Fixes and Improvements to Asynchronous GPU:
  
  * New games boot with `Async` - **Fire Emblem: 3 Houses**, **Cadence of Hyrule**, and **Pokk√©n Tournament**.
  * Fixed the issue where games would suddenly slowdown and report wrong framerates.
  * Fixed the issue where some games would surpass frame limiting.
  * Fixed the issue where dynamic resolution re-scaler would trigger in **Super Mario Odyssey** with full-speed and wouldn't trigger heavily for under-speed games.
  * Removed artificial fence which limited `Async` to `9 ms`. 
  Now `Async` will be limited by the game and this gives performance boosts in many graphic intensive games.

`Patreon Changes`

- Implemented a new `Fair Cycle Core Timer` in order to spread work evenly on the four emulated cores.
- Improved the `New Scheduler` even further, by fixing bugs and implementing `Thread Pre-emption`.
  These improvements to the scheduler have improved performance in games like **Fire Emblem:3 Houses**, **Hyrule Warriors** and **Resident Evil 4**. <br>
  It also has allowed **Astral Chain** and other games to boot (***Not fully playable yet!***).

### GPU Emulation

`Public Changes`

- [#2891](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2891) - Implemented `RGBX16F Format` which is used by **Rocket League** to render graphics. 
- [#2870](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2870) - Implemented a `MME draw calls in-liner` which accumulates draw calls from the Macro Interpreter Engine (MME) and sends them as a single unified draw call, thus improving performance significantly in some titles. 
- [#2869](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2869), [#2878](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2878), and [#2855](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2855) - Implemented shader instructions: `SULD`, `ICMP`, `SHFL`(Nvidia only) and `SUATOM`.
- [#2872](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2872) - Fixed memory mapping so that it won't call GPU flushing unnecessarily anymore. 
- [#2868](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2868) - Fixed mipmap filtering. 
- [#2833](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2833) - Fixed stencil testing. 
- [#2914](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2914) - Corrected `Fermi2D` to work within crop areas in order to avoid issues in Vulkan.
- [#2917](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/pull/2917) - Added deduction method for `blits` which helps figure if a `blit` is on depth textures. 
This avoids using the fall-back method of buffer copy.

`Patreon Changes`

- Implemented `fast BRX` and fixed `TXQ`. 
This fixes graphics in **Crash Team Racing** & **The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening**, and also makes shaders a lot easier to be read by AMD and Intel drivers.
- Reworked shader cache system to support `fast BRX` and `TXQ` fixes.

{{< message "Link's Awakening needs some stuff!!" >}}
**The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening** currently needs a few things to work:

 - a save file, to skip the initial movie. 
 - set your controller settings to `Custom > Docked > Pro Controller`. 
 - And `Async` needs to be `OFF`.

{{< message "Shader caches need to be regenerated!!" >}}
Because of the reworked shader cache system, all previously generated shader caches are `no longer valid`.<br>
**Users will have to regenerate their shader caches for all games.**
